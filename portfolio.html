        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Marazon is a game where you use the arrow keys to move the character <br>
        and try to reach the goal line. While playing the game, the player can <br>
        collect apples to get more points but they must be aware that touching <br>
        the enemy sprite will cause them to lose the game. The apples will be <br>
        spawned randomly and so will the enemy when it first appears. The larger<br>
        the size of your character, the higher the difficulty is.</p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>This game was created with the goal of reaching the goal while being <br>
        blocked by obstacles. Inspiration for the game came from other games <br>
        that had the player use the character and try to dash to the end of the <br>
        stage. In the development process, two successsful points were that the <br>
        sprites appeared or disappeared on cue and that the player could choose<br>
        the character that he/she would use. Two obstacles were getting the game <br>
        to play the next stage and creating apples. In the game, the player is <br>
        easily able to transition to the stage but must be aware that some apples<br>
        are fakes aimed with delaying the player. If there was more time, aspects<br>
        of the game that would be improved would most likely adjusting how the <br>
        difficulty works and maybe making it so that the apples are individually<br>
        collected instead of a mass at once.</p>
        <h4>More Blocks + Algorithm</h4>
        <img src="moreblocks.PNG">
        <p>An algorithm gives the well-defined procedure of how the computer should <br>
        solve a problem. This algortihm is also a "More Blocks" and is defined to <br>
        tell the computer how to handle the sprite and do certain things when the <br>
        conditional is fulfilled. In particular, it changes the color effect by an <br>
        integer five times and then plays a finger snap.</p>
        <h2 id = "Bank Story">Bank Heist</h2>
        <p>The user is at a bank. Through the user's decisions, the user can choose<br>
        to be a security guard or a bank goer. The paths diverge so the user can choose<br>
        to attempt to stop a robbery, stop a robbery, do nothing about the robbery, <br>
        or even commit the robbery.</p>

        <p>My partner and I were assigned to create a story that with user input <br>
        could arive at multiple endings. The first and largest problem was what to <br>
        make the story about. We brainstormed with random ideas and examples that <br>
        we previously knew. That was when my partner thought of an idea we agreed <br>
        on, a bank setting with a robber. As we began our story on Google Drawings, <br> 
        we began to make more decision points and routes that the user could follow <br>
        until we ended up diverging from our original plan of having the robber <br>
        route as the main path. After using repl.it to implement a Python program, <br>
        we started off with importing code from our teacher that would type out <br>
        lines of text instead of printing the block of text all at once. Then, it <br>
        was finally time to define the scenes of the story. A defined scene would <br>
        ask the user to accurately input a plot choice and would then use if-else <br>
        statements to call certain scenes. For example, the user is told that they <br>
        are at a bank and are asked to input whether they want to be a security <br>
        guard or a bank goer. Depending on the user's choice, they would be sent <br>
        down the guardLife() or the personLife(). The process of defining scenes, <br>
        asking for user input, and writing if-else statments was repetive as we <br>
        followed the flow chart we made about how users could diverge or converge <br>
        their paths. Since we were able to finish coding the story early, I decided <br>
        to go back to our original plan of a robber and made that a hidden route <br>
        in the diverging paths for a bank goer.</p>
        <p>The difficult part came when we had to debug the program, making sure <br>
        that each pathway worked properly and that the grammar was on point. As we <br>
        were constantly running the program, a problem came up, the moderate typing <br>
        speed would be troublesome as we needed to run the program multiple times. <br>
        Therefore, we used a shortkey to find and replace all the numbers into a <br>
        variable. Lastly, we had to make sure that all the code involving user input <br>
        would work. This included while loops to confirm that the program would print <br>
        out 'Invalid' if the user input was not in the choices provided and fixing<br>
        any writing typos in if-else statements. </p>
        <p>Organizing scenes of our story into functions is a form of procedural <br>
        abstaction because it assigns each scene a function and gives it a certain <br>
        task of leading the user to the next scene which is very simple. Instead of <br>
        following the option of making continuous nested if-else statements, we called <br>
        and defined scenes into new functions because it gives the advantages of <br>
        reducing complexity and allows for implementation of more complex procedures. </p>
        <p>Because I prefer web novels, I won't be giving out the name. However, I <br>
        liked the novel because the author gave the readers a reason to like each <br>
        relevant character or at least not totally dislike the character by giving <br>
        character development along with backstory.</p>
