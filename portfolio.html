        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Marazon is a game where you use the arrow keys to move the character <br>
        and try to reach the goal line. While playing the game, the player can <br>
        collect apples to get more points but they must be aware that touching <br>
        the enemy sprite will cause them to lose the game. The apples will be <br>
        spawned randomly and so will the enemy when it first appears. The larger<br>
        the size of your character, the higher the difficulty is.</p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>This game was created with the goal of reaching the goal while being <br>
        blocked by obstacles. Inspiration for the game came from other games <br>
        that had the player use the character and try to dash to the end of the <br>
        stage. In the development process, two successsful points were that the <br>
        sprites appeared or disappeared on cue and that the player could choose<br>
        the character that he/she would use. Two obstacles were getting the game <br>
        to play the next stage and creating apples. In the game, the player is <br>
        easily able to transition to the stage but must be aware that some apples<br>
        are fakes aimed with delaying the player. If there was more time, aspects<br>
        of the game that would be improved would most likely adjusting how the <br>
        difficulty works and maybe making it so that the apples are individually<br>
        collected instead of a mass at once.</p>

        <h4>Algorithm</h4>
        <img src="moreblocks.PNG">
        <p>An algorithm gives the step-by-step precdure of how the computer should <br>
        solve a problem. This one in particular tells the computer how to handle <br>
        the sprite and do certain things when the conditional is fulfilled.</p>
